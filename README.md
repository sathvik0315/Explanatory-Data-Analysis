# Explanatory-Data-Analysis

- This project, led by me, is a mini college project aimed at performing explanatory data analysis using a dataset from Kaggle focused on an online retail company based in the United Kingdom.

## Overview :
🌟 The full form of EDA means Explanatory Data Analysis.  
🌟 It is a process of performing initial investigations on data.  
🌟 By doing this kind of analysis, it helps us to discover patterns and standards.  
🌟 It clearly explains the summary of statistics and graphical representations.
